The forward osmosis system used was a plant that was designed for
desalination of sea salt water. The process of concentrating wastewater
to produce clean secondary water was carried out in a similar way to the
forward osmosis desalination method, since the basic principle of this
method is the same for all types of treatment, recovery and
concentration. The methods differ only in that, depending on the
purpose, chemical composition, concentration and osmotic pressure of the
feed solution, different draw solutions are used, respectively higher
osmotic pressure than the feed solution for greater water flux through
the semipermeable membrane. And also, different membranes of different
nature are applied relative to the purpose of the solution.
