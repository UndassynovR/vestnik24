{\bfseries Introduction.} Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely and
comprehensively utilized, playing a crucial role in addressing various
practical tasks in military, industrial, and domestic spheres. WSNs
represent a multifunctional communication foundation of cyber-physical
systems with artificial intelligence elements, providing connectivity
between various sensor devices and systems that can collect, process,
and transmit environmental data in real-time. This foundation enables
effective automatic monitoring and control of various processes and
objects over extensive and hard-to-reach areas {[}1, 2{]}.

However, the use of WSNs is associated with certain risks due to their
security vulnerabilities. Attacks by malicious actors on such networks
can lead to serious consequences, including data interception,
tampering, and disruption of the functionality of technical equipment,
particularly sensor devices that are fundamental elements of WSNs.
Consequently, there is increasing importance in developing effective
measures to counter potential threats within WSN security frameworks.

A critical measure to combat these threats is the development of
efficient methods for detecting, recogni-zing, and preventing network
attacks. Specifically, analytical and simulation models of attacker
actions on WSNs allow for the study of processes within WSNs induced by
these attacks. Such models are based on mathematical and statistical
descriptions of attacker and defender behaviors using real network data,
parameters, and characteristics. They enable the creation of virtual
environments for comprehensive simula-tion of WSNs, including the
operation of sensor nodes, communication processes between nodes over
radio channels, data reception and transmission, and routing {[}1, 3,
4{]}.

This study aims to conduct testing and comparative analysis of natural
and simulation models of attacks on WSNs, attack detection algorithms,
and to develop recommendations for their effective implementation.

{\bfseries Materials and methods.} \emph{Analytical review of literary
sources on the research issue.}

There are several different types of attacks that can occur in WSNs.

Threats to confidentiality involve interception and observation, where
attackers intercept data or analyze traffic to obtain confidential
information. Threats to integrity are associated with data modification,
source impersonation, message replay, and message denial, which lead to
data distortion and incorrect network operation. Attackers can alter
messages, spoof sources, replay intercepted data, or deny
sending/receiving messages. Availability threats aim to disrupt message
delivery, causing network service denial. These attacks include Denial
of Service (DoS), node capture, and resource depletion attacks, leading
to node overload or network disconnection. Such attacks can severely
disrupt network operation, highlighting the importance of protecting
against them. {[}2, 4, 5{]}

The paper presents {[}6{]} a new intrusion detection model for WSNs
using fuzzy neural networks and feedforward neural networks.
Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves detection
rates averaging 97.8\% with maximum detection accuracy of 98.8\%.
Evaluations were compared against benchmark models based on support
vector machines (SVM), decision trees (DT), and random forest (RF)
models.

Authors {[}7{]} introduced detection of multiple attacks in wireless
sensor networks using artificial neural networks. The dataset is split
into training and testing using a multi-layer perceptron artificial
neural network to detect ten classes of attacks, including DoS attacks.
Research using benchmark datasets UNSW-NB, WSN-DS, NSL-KDD, and
CICIDS2018 showed that the proposed system achieves an average detection

In article {[}8{]}, the use of spatial information for detecting and
localizing multiple attacks across single and multiple nodes is
presented. A scalable and energy-efficient anomaly detection mechanism
based on clusters (SEECAD) is described for detecting DoS attacks
without key management schemes to enhance network lifespan. Detection
speed, false alarm rate, packet delivery ratio, overhead costs, energy
consumption, and average packet delay are various performance metrics
used to evaluate network performance.

In {[}9{]}, an enhanced high-performance secure routing protocol based
on clustering is proposed. A key feature of this protocol is its
consideration of aspects such as energy consumption, packet reduction,
congestion management, encrypted data transmission, and monitoring of
malicious nodes to improve data management quality. To demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed method, performance metrics such as
ransomware attack detection level, ergodic residual energy per round,
early clone attack detection, throughput maximization, delay, maximum
throughput, and network lifespan maximization were used.

The works {[}10{]} conducted modeling to demonstrate that the proposed
EdDSA-XOR functionality reduces time and energy costs by 0.13\% and
0.07\% respectively, compared to other methods. Node authentication in
the network was tested against "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

The paper proposes {[}11{]} an effective method for detecting black hole
and Sybil attacks using the Adaptive Taylor Sail (Adaptive Taylor-SFO)
algorithm. The BSS nodes are modeled in the network, followed by routing
using Adaptive Taylor-SFO. The router was developed by integrating the
Adaptive concept with the Taylor series and the Sail Fish optimizer
(SFO) to select the optimal route considering adaptability metrics such
as delay, energy, and distance. Black hole and Sybil attack detection is
performed by the Deep stacked automatic encoder. Thus, the proposed
system effectively classifies normal, black hole, and Sybil attacks. The
analysis of the reviewed works made it possible to determine the most
common types of attacks on WSNs (Table 1), the mechanisms of their
impact, possible consequences and methods of mitigating the
consequences.

routing mechanisms to redirect or block data flows. Attackers exploit
vulnerabilities across various layers of the network protocol stack.

Man-in-the-middle attacks exploit the absence of secure communication
channels and can occur at various protocol levels, including

\emph{Description of the empirical models used for attack detection}
\begin{multicols}{2}

Natural models for detecting attacks in WSNs involve physically
implemented networks where nodes and sensors are deployed in real
operational conditions. These models utilize real devices such as
microcontrollers, radio modules, and sensors that interact within
realistic environmental settings. The primary advantage of natural
models lies in their ability to accurately reproduce real network
operation scenarios, including potential external interferences and
physical attacks.

Research on natural models for attack detection in wireless sensor
networks includes functional and quantitative characteristics. Attack
detection methods are categorized into signature-based, anomaly-based,
and hybrid approaches, covering attacks on availability,
confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Hardware and network
characteristics of sensors and nodes, data processing algorithms, and
monitoring systems play a crucial role. Quantitative metrics include
detection accuracy, detection time, energy consumption, throughput,
delay, and scalability.

For instance, platforms like TinyOS and Contiki are used to test
intrusion detection systems, achieving 95\% accuracy with low false
positive rates. Machine learning-based systems such as K-means and SVM
can achieve classification accuracies up to 98\%. Distributed detection
methods include autonomous algorithms that depend on node density and
algorithm complexity {[}15, 16{]}. Table 2 presents empirical
experiments on attack detection and their outcomes.

1. & jamming attack & An experiment to simulate a jamming attack was
conducted using a powerful transmitter in Omnet++, a platform for
modeling network systems. The experiment involved creating a wireless
sensor network of 100 nodes with a random topology and a transmission
radius of 50 meters. The experiment consisted of three stages: network
initialization without attack, introduction of the jamming transmitter,
and data collection. The collected data included received signal
strength indicator (RSSI), packet loss, and transmission delay,
amounting to approximately 10,000 records. Data processing was performed
using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms such as
K-means and SVM. The data processing methodology included data
filtering, analysis of signal strength levels, and anomaly
classification {[}17, 18{]}. & The results showed that the jamming
attack significantly reduces communication quality and increases
latency. Simulation algorithms were able to detect the attack with 94\%
accuracy by analyzing signal strength and packet loss rates. The
experiment demonstrated the possibility of using this technique in real
wireless sensor networks. \\
\hline
2. & resource exhaustion attack & A simulation experiment for a resource
exhaustion attack was conducted using the NS-3 network simulator. The
experimental setup included a wireless sensor network comprising 50
nodes, each equipped with a limited battery. The experiment was planned
by creating the network, setting battery parameters, and launching a
series of attacks involving sending a large number of false requests to
the nodes. During the experiment, data on energy consumption, node
response time, and failure rate were collected. Approximately 5000 data
records were gathered, covering all stages of the attack. Data
processing was carried out using an energy consumption monitoring
methodology developed and described in {[}19{]}. This methodology
included data filtering, analysis of energy consumption time series, and
detection of deviations from normal behavior. & Algorithms based on this
methodology were able to identify abnormal behavior with an accuracy of
89\% and an average attack detection time of 2.3 seconds. The
effectiveness of the methodology was confirmed by its high accuracy and
rapid detection of attacks. The experiment demonstrated that the
proposed methodology is effective for application in real-world
conditions of wireless sensor networks. \\
\hline
3. & replay attack & Experimental studies aimed at examining replay
attacks were conducted using a model created in the Simulink
environment. In this experiment, the model simulated the repeated
transmission of intercepted messages, mimicking a scenario where an
attacker could re-execute previously executed commands. The experimental
setup consisted of a network model including several nodes and data
transmission mechanisms configured to implement replay attacks. The
experiment planning involved configuring model parameters, defining
attack characteristics, and selecting detection methods.

During the experiment, data related to message timestamps, as well as
parameters of authentication and integrity verification methods, were
collected. The total amount of gathered data was about 2,000 records,
covering various attack scenarios and the system\textquotesingle s
responses to them. The data were processed using algorithms based on
analyzing message timestamps and authentication methods. The data
processing methodology included filtering out repeated messages and
verifying their compliance with expected time intervals {[}19{]}. & The
experimental results showed that algorithms based on timestamps and
authentication methods successfully detected replayed messages with an
accuracy of 97\%, significantly reducing the risk of executing false
commands and enhancing the effectiveness of the replay attack defense
system. \\
\hline
4. & spoofing & Experimental studies focused on spoofing attacks were
conducted using Simulink software. The experiment was designed by
creating scenarios in which an attacker sent false messages, pretending
to be legitimate network nodes, with the aim of infiltrating the system.
Parameters of the transmitted messages, such as node identifier, message
content, and timestamp, were recorded for data collection. The total
amount of data collected was approximately 3,000 records, covering
various attack scenarios and network responses. For data analysis,
algorithms for node identity verification and behavior analysis
developed by the experiment\textquotesingle s authors were applied. The
data processing methodology included the identification of anomalous
nodes, comparison of their behavior with samples of normal functioning,
and detection of deviations {[}20{]}. & As a result of the experiment,
the model was able to effectively detect spoofing attacks with 92\%
accuracy. The system\textquotesingle s response time to detect the
attack was 1.8 seconds, demonstrating the high reactivity and efficiency
of the developed algorithms. The obtained results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed spoofing attack protection methodology and
its readiness for practical application in real network systems. \\

In general, both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, but
their combination can provide the most complete and reliable analysis of
attacks on WSNs. Full-scale models provide high accuracy and data
relevance, while simulation models offer flexibility and
cost-effectiveness. The optimal solution is to use full-scale
experiments to verify and calibrate simulation models, which allows you
to combine the advantages of both approaches.

{\bfseries Conclusions.} Analysis of full-scale and simulation models and
algorithms for identifying attacks on WSNs shows that both approaches
have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Full-scale models
provide highly accurate and up-to-date data because they reproduce
real-life network operating conditions. However, their use is associated
with high costs and limited scalability. Simulation models, in contrast,
offer flexibility and cost-effectiveness, allowing easy adjustment of
parameters and scale-up of experiments, but may not fully account for
all real-world physical factors.

Based on the presented data, we can conclude that the combined use of
full-scale and simulation approaches is optimal in the context of
ensuring the security of wireless sensor networks. The integration of
natural and simulation methods makes it possible to jointly use their
advantages, ensuring high accuracy and reliability of attack detection
algorithms. Using field data to calibrate and verify simulation models
plays an important role in achieving high accuracy in network
vulnerability analysis. Recommendations for improving models and
algorithms, including developing flexible and scalable simulation
models, improving attack detection algorithms, and regularly updating
models, are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the attack
detection system. This combined use of methods and the development of
infrastructure for field experiments seem to be the most effective ways
to improve the security of wireless sensor networks in the face of
rapidly changing threats. This work by the staff of the International
Scientific Complex "Astana" is carried out with the financial support of
the Science Committee of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of
the Republic of Kazakhstan (Grant No. AP19680345).
